        <h2>About Nye Data Consulting</h2>

        <section>
            <h3>Why We Started</h3>
            <p>Nye Data Consulting was founded to give organizations—especially law firms—a better way to work with
                data. We saw too many consulting firms prioritize process over value, charging clients for unnecessary
                meetings and layers of staff. We're here to do things differently: clean, honest work that delivers
                results without wasting time or money.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
            <p>At many firms, clients end up paying for junior consultants to learn on the job—often under the guidance
                of other consultants, all billed at high rates. We don't believe in that. When you hire Nye Data
                Consulting, you get experienced professionals doing real work from day one. No hidden inefficiencies. No
                indirect compromise.</p>
            <p>We also avoid fluff. No drawn-out meetings, no recycled slide decks, no over-polished reports with little
                substance. Just clear, direct communication and results you can rely on.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <p>We specialize in helping legal teams and other professionals make sense of complicated data. Whether it's
                analyzing massive claims databases, building litigation-focused statistical models, or automating
                tedious workflows, we bring technical expertise and strategic thinking to every project.</p>
            <p>We've worked with top-tier law firms, litigation experts, and research teams under tight deadlines and
                high stakes. We're comfortable navigating ambiguity, collaborating with domain specialists, and
                delivering sharp, defensible insights backed by clear logic.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Our Focus</h3>
            <p>We don't do management consulting or legal strategy—we do data. And we're really good at it. Our work is
                grounded in rigorous analysis, reproducible code, and transparent communication. That focus allows us to
                deliver faster, cleaner, and more effective solutions tailored to your specific needs.</p>
        </section>

        <section>

                <li>Statistical and predictive modeling (regression, forecasting, simulation)</li>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Who We Help</h3>
            <p>While much of our work is in the legal world, we also support researchers, analysts, and small businesses
                who want to make smarter decisions with their data. If you need a partner who takes your work seriously
                and treats your time and trust with respect, let's talk.</p>
